# SelfDrivingCarEngineer
This is a repo containing all my works in Udacity Nanodegree - Self Driving Car Engineer.

This program will cover the techniques that power self-driving cars across the full stack of a vehicleâ€™s autonomous capabilities.
Here I demonstrate computer vision and deep learning approaches toward perception problems like lane finding
and classifying traffic signs, as well as a full end-to-end algorithm for driving with behavioral cloning. From this course I also learn
how to track objects from radar and lidar data with sensor fusion. From there, I can implement the concepts behind
localization, path planning and control, making sure vehicle knows where it is in the environment and how to navigate
through it.
